so this is the clone of twitter app which made to replicate certain screenshots shared with me.
there are six important files here
to use this app u will have to use react-native init
will initial creation of the app used yarn than i uninstalled it
thereafter i have used npm
also i have installed react-navigation
once u create a app on ur local machine using 'react-native init "app-name"'
then open that folder and delete the app.js file and copy all these files and paste them in that folder
for running this app i have used AVD from android studio pixel_xl_7.1.1

Happy HAppy
